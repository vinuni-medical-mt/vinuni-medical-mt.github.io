# VinUniversity Medical Machine Translation Research Project

This repository hosts the project website for the VinUniversity Medical Machine Translation Research Project, focusing on advancing Vietnamese-English translation for medical texts and speech.

## About the Project

We are a collaborative research initiative at VinUniversity (Vietnam) addressing the critical need for accurate Vietnamese-English translation in both clinical and educational medical contexts. Our work bridges language barriers in healthcare and medical education through cutting-edge machine translation and speech recognition technologies.
